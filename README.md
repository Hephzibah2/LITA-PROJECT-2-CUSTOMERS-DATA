# LITA-PROJECT-2-CUSTOMERS-DATA
To show all that I have learned from Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA), The incubator Hub 

### PROJECT TITLE:
LITA CAPSTONE DATASET: CUSTOMERS DATA

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This Data Analysis is to identify segments and trends of customers data for a subscription service

### DATA SOURCES
The Primary source of data used is LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx

### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](www.micosoft.com)
1. For Data cleaning
2. For Analysis
- SQL- Structured Query Language: For querying data
- Power BI [Download here](www.microsoft.com)
1. For Data visualisation
- Github: Portfolio building

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
I performed the following actions
1. Data inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
1. What is the most popular subscription type?
2. What is the average subscription duration?
3. What is the total revenue by subscription type?

### DATA ANALYSIS
 This is where I talk about the functions and codes I used
 - E.g
   '''.  SQL
   SELECT count([CustomerID])as [No of Customers Per Region],[Region] from [dbo].[customer data]
 group by[Region]
'''.

data]
'''

### DATA SUMMARY
 I used Microsoft Excel to give summary of my data. This will help the organisation to be able to grasp the main ideas quickly and help in comparison and evaluation.
 1. Sum of Revenue by Region

### DATA QUERYING
I was able to make sure the data gotten from microsoft excel was accurate. I used SQL server to retrieve the total number of customers from each region,find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers,find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months,calculate the average subscription duration for all customers and do other interesting things. 

Here is a picture of the query

### DATA VISUALISATION
With the use of Power BI, I am able to illustrate every summary drawn from Microsoft Excel making it easy for the organisation to understand. Through this visualisations they are able to identify different trends and patterns and understand customer's behaviour and preferences.
